-- * Display the total number of events in Every Action. Useful right now to identify gaps in the combined numbers, but should probably be removed for the final dashboard.*

-- Base table: https://platform.civisanalytics.com/spa/#/scripts/sql/100953079
---- This table contains all events and participants for those events in Every Action.

SELECT
	COUNT (DISTINCT ea_eventid)
  		-- ^Need to select distinct event ids since the base table contains all participants for events, not just events.

-- These lines for filtering in Sisense. !De-comment in Sisense!
