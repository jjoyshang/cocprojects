, city  -- Can filter by this field
, state  -- Can filter by this field
, zipcode  -- Can filter by this field
, county  -- Can filter by this field

Other filters included in the code (which are not reflected in output fields):
  - Whether someone is Active (on List 1 but not List 8)
  
  - Whether someone has RECEIVED specific mailing(s) (by mailing id)
  - Whether someone has RECEIVED mailings with specific tag(s)
  - Whether someone has RECEIVED mailings within a date range
  
  - Whether someone has OPENED specific mailing(s) (by mailing id)
  - Whether someone has OPENED mailings with specific tag(s)
  - Whether someone has OPENED mailings within a date range
  - Whether someone has OPENED __ number or more mailings (influenced by other OPENS filters. For instance, you could combine them to say people who have opened 3 or more mailers in the last 2 months.)
  
  - Whether someone has TAKEN ACTION on specific mailing(s) (by mailing id)
  - Whether someone has TAKEN ACTION on with specific tag(s)
  - Whether someone has TAKEN ACTION on within a date range
  - Whether someone has TAKEN ACTION on __ number or more mailings (influenced by other ACTION filters. For instance, you could combine them to say people who have taken action on 2 or more mailers with *CRIMINAL JUSTICE tags)

  - Zipcode radius. Include people a number of miles in a radius out from a specific zipcode.
