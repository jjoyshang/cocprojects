-- Where there are two versions of a field, I am selecting EA first. This is because Mob events stop syncing to EA 24 hours after the event occurs. Therefore, we encourage staff to update events in EA and view that data as more up-to-date. Where there is no EA field I use a Mob field OR use a Null function (NVL) to pull from the EA table first, then the Mob table.
